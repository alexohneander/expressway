# Expressway

Expressway is an innovative project developed to streamline and simplify the integration of various microservices within our company. By providing a centralized platform for handling authentication and authorization, this gateway aims to enhance security, improve communication, and foster seamless interoperability between different microservices. Leveraging the power and performance of Rust, the API Gateway ensures efficient data flow while maintaining robust security measures.

### Goals
The primary objectives of the Expressway API Gateway project are as follows:

1. **Routing and Request Handling:** Efficiently route incoming requests to their respective microservices based on predefined rules and configurations.

2. **Authentication and Authorization Middleware:** Implement middleware to handle user authentication and authorization, enforcing access control policies uniformly across microservices.

3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Apply rate limiting and request throttling to manage traffic and prevent abuse or overload of microservices.

4. **Caching:** Introduce caching mechanisms to store frequently requested data and reduce response times, optimizing overall performance.

5. **Load Balancing:** Employ load balancing techniques to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of microservices for improved scalability and fault tolerance.

6. **API Documentation:** Generate and maintain comprehensive API documentation to facilitate easy integration for developers.

7. **Monitoring and Logging System:** Implement a robust monitoring and logging system to track and analyze the performance of microservices and the gateway itself.

8. **Security:** Employ encryption and secure communication protocols to safeguard sensitive data during transmission.
